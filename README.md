DEMO
-----
This is a demo, nothing to see here. 

You will need node.js to compile.

Install node.js and then in the root of this project './builder.sh'

You may have trouble compiling; there is a bug upstream in wintersmith-stylus recently introduced.

If you see errors about not being able to find 'plugin', just cd node_modules/wintersmith-stylus && coffee -c plugin.coffee
